# The-Chemdemming-of-Isaac
A video game made in my senior year of high school meant to mimic the indie game "The Binding of Isaac" with a few personal touches.

The program primarily uses Pygame and Pymunk for visuals and physics respectively. The game replicates The Binding of Isaac's room and floor generation.

To play the game run the mainGame file. You may need some libraries installed like Pygame, Pymunk, and noise.

Instructions to play the game can be found in the user manual file.
